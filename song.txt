Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low
I’m finally holding on to letting go

(I’ll never kill myself to save my soul)
I’m finally holding on to letting go
(I didn’t come this far to sink so low)
I’m finally holding on to letting go

I’m just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest
When you live in a hole
Why does the Hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a Lord and you pray to it
You’re so demanding when you want the truth,
But your stories don’t read for me

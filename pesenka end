Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low
I’m finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the Devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God,
But did you think you’d shake your own?
This Killing Field is all grown over
The Motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The Anti-Antagonist is back in style
MYOPIC
Cannot see straight
DYSTOPIC
One sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your Bibles don’t work on me

Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone but how was I to know?
I didn’t come this far to sink so low
I’m finally holding on to letting…
GO
